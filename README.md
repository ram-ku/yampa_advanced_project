This is an advanced level class project given by Neil Sculthorpe to use FRP.Yampa library. This animation has more than one ball, there is pong at the bottom of the screen which prevents the balls from going off the screen, there two spaceships which move towards the mouse click on the screen. The smaller spaceship follows the larger one. The bigger spaceship keeps producing new balls at regular interval of time like 30 secs and the balls are of different color. The mouse click on the page also creates a new ball.

To run:
		1. import the file AnimatePong.hs in GHC
		2. issue the following command
			main
		3. Go to the browser, url localhost:3000 to see the animation
		
Note: The project won't compile due to version differnce of Blank Canvas. Needs fixing.
